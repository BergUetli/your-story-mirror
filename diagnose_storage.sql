-- Run this in Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor to diagnose storage issues

-- ===== 1. CHECK BUCKET CONFIGURATION =====

-- ===== 8. SUMMARY & ACTION ITEMS =====
SELECT

-- ===== ADDITIONAL DEBUG INFO =====
-- Uncomment these if you need more detailed debugging:

-- Check all storage buckets:
-- SELECT * FROM storage.buckets;

-- Check all storage policies (not just voice):
-- SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'objects' AND schemaname = 'storage';

-- Check recent storage objects:
-- SELECT name, bucket_id, created_at FROM storage.objects ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;
