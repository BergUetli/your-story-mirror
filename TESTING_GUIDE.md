# 🧪 Testing Guide - Easy Ways to Test Without Real Emails

## Problem
Testing new user signups requires real email addresses, which is cumbersome and time-consuming.

---

## ✅ **Solution 1: Use the Test Page (Recommended)**

I've created a standalone test page that simulates the entire onboarding flow without requiring authentication!

### Access the Test Page

**File**: `test-onboarding.html`

**How to Use**:
1. Open in browser: `http://localhost:5173/test-onboarding.html` (when dev server is running)
2. Or open the file directly in your browser
3. Fill in all 13 steps
4. See the exact JSON data that would be saved to the database
5. Click "Start Over" to test again

**Benefits**:
- ✅ No email required
- ✅ Instant testing
- ✅ See exact database format
- ✅ Test validation and flow
- ✅ Test as many times as you want

## ✅ **Solution 2: Disable Email Confirmation in Supabase**

Make Supabase skip email verification for faster testing.

### Steps

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. **Select Your Project**: Click on "your-story-mirror" project
3. **Navigate to Authentication**:
   - Left sidebar → **Authentication**
   - Click **Settings** (or **Providers**)
4. **Find Email Settings**:
   - Look for "Email Auth" or "Email Provider"
5. **Disable Email Confirmations**:
   - Toggle OFF: **"Enable email confirmations"**
   - Or set **"Confirm email"** to disabled
6. **Save Changes**

### After Disabling
Now you can sign up with ANY email (even fake ones):
- `test1@test.com`
- `user2@example.com`
- `demo@demo.com`
- `anything@fake.email`

**No verification needed!** Instant access.

### ⚠️ Important Notes
- **Development Only**: This is for testing only
- **Re-enable for Production**: Before going live, re-enable email confirmations
- **Security**: Don't leave this disabled in production!

## ✅ **Solution 3: Use Email Aliases (Gmail)**

If you want to use real emails but still test multiple accounts:

### Gmail Plus Addressing
If your email is `youremail@gmail.com`, you can use:
- `youremail+test1@gmail.com`
- `youremail+test2@gmail.com`
- `youremail+user1@gmail.com`
- `youremail+anything@gmail.com`

**All emails go to your main inbox!**

Supabase treats them as different accounts, but they all deliver to you.

### Example
Main email: `berguetli@gmail.com`

Test accounts:
- `berguetli+test1@gmail.com` → Goes to berguetli@gmail.com
- `berguetli+test2@gmail.com` → Goes to berguetli@gmail.com
- `berguetli+onboarding@gmail.com` → Goes to berguetli@gmail.com

## ✅ **Solution 4: Use Temporary Email Services**

For one-off tests without cluttering your inbox:

### Recommended Services
1. **TempMail**: https://temp-mail.org
   - Instant disposable email
   - Auto-refreshes for confirmation emails
   - Free and fast

2. **Guerrilla Mail**: https://www.guerrillamail.com
   - Disposable email addresses
   - No registration needed

3. **10 Minute Mail**: https://10minutemail.com
   - Email expires after 10 minutes
   - Perfect for quick tests

### How to Use
1. Open temp email service
2. Copy the generated email address
3. Use it to sign up in Memory Scape
4. Check the temp inbox for confirmation email
5. Click confirm link
6. Test onboarding

## 📊 **What to Test**

### UI/UX Testing (Use test-onboarding.html)
- [ ] All 13 steps display correctly
- [ ] Icons show for each step
- [ ] Progress bar updates
- [ ] Required field validation works
- [ ] Optional fields can be skipped
- [ ] Back button works
- [ ] Textarea expands properly
- [ ] Dropdown shows all options
- [ ] Date picker works

- [ ] Comma-separated values parse to arrays
- [ ] JSONB life event saves correctly
- [ ] Completeness score calculates right
- [ ] Profile shows in database
- [ ] Welcome message uses preferred_name

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### Test page doesn't load
- Make sure dev server is running: `npm run dev`
- Try opening the HTML file directly in browser
- Check browser console for errors

### Can't disable email confirmation
- Look for "Email Auth" settings in Supabase
- Check under "Authentication" → "Providers" → "Email"
- Some projects call it "Confirm email" or "Email confirmations"

### Gmail plus addressing not working
- Make sure you're using Gmail (not other providers)
- Some services don't support plus addressing
- Try using dots instead: `your.email@gmail.com` vs `youremail@gmail.com`
