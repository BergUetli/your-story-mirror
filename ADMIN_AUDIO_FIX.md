# Admin Dashboard Audio Save Test - Fixed

## Problem
The Admin dashboard "Test audio file save and retrieval" button was failing with this error:

```
❌ Audio File Save Test - FAILED
Database save failed: Could not find the 'metadata' column of 'voice_recordings' in the schema cache
```

## Root Cause
The `VoiceArchiveDiagnosticsPanel.tsx` component (lines 1201-1206) was attempting to insert a `metadata` JSON object into the `voice_recordings` table:

```typescript
metadata: {
  testType: 'audio_save_verification',
  audioContent: 'multi-tone_test_signal',
  frequencies: [440, 880],
  createdBy: 'admin_diagnostics'
}
```

However, the `voice_recordings` table schema (defined in `supabase/migrations/20251018200000_add_voice_recordings.sql`) does NOT include a `metadata` column. Supabase's schema cache correctly identified this mismatch and rejected the insert.

## Solution
**Fixed in commit `8207634`**

Removed the `metadata` field entirely and moved the metadata information into the existing `topics` array:

```typescript
// Before (BROKEN):
topics: ['audio_test', 'file_save', 'diagnostics'],
metadata: { testType: 'audio_save_verification', ... }

// After (FIXED):
topics: ['audio_test', 'file_save', 'diagnostics', 'multi-tone_test_signal', 'audio_save_verification']
```

The `topics` column already exists in the schema as a `TEXT[]` array, so it can store these tags without any schema changes.

## Table Schema Reference
The actual `voice_recordings` table columns are:
- id, user_id, session_id, recording_type
- storage_path, original_filename, file_size_bytes, duration_seconds
- mime_type, compression_type, sample_rate, bit_rate
- transcript_text, conversation_summary, memory_ids, topics
- session_mode, conversation_phase
- is_compressed, retention_days, expires_at, created_at, updated_at

**Note**: No `metadata` column exists or is needed.

## Testing
After this fix, the Admin dashboard audio file save test should:
1. ✅ Create synthetic audio (3 seconds, 440Hz + 880Hz tones)
2. ✅ Upload to Supabase storage (`voice-recordings` bucket)
3. ✅ Save metadata to database (without schema errors)
4. ✅ Verify file retrieval and playback capability
5. ✅ Display success message with file details

## Next Steps
1. Deploy the fix to your environment
2. Test the Admin dashboard audio file save button
3. Verify the test completes successfully
