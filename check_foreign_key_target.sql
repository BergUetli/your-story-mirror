-- Check what table the user_profiles foreign key actually references

-- Method 1: Using information_schema
SELECT
  tc.constraint_name,
  tc.table_schema,
  tc.table_name,
  kcu.column_name,
  ccu.table_schema AS foreign_table_schema,
  ccu.table_name AS foreign_table_name,
  ccu.column_name AS foreign_column_name
FROM information_schema.table_constraints AS tc
JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu
  ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
  AND tc.table_schema = kcu.table_schema
JOIN information_schema.constraint_column_usage AS ccu
  ON ccu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name
  AND ccu.table_schema = tc.table_schema
WHERE tc.constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY'
  AND tc.table_name = 'user_profiles';

-- Method 2: Using pg_constraint (more reliable)
SELECT
  conname AS constraint_name,
  conrelid::regclass AS table_name,
  confrelid::regclass AS foreign_table_name,
  a.attname AS column_name,
  af.attname AS foreign_column_name
FROM pg_constraint c
JOIN pg_attribute a ON a.attrelid = c.conrelid AND a.attnum = ANY(c.conkey)
JOIN pg_attribute af ON af.attrelid = c.confrelid AND af.attnum = ANY(c.confkey)
WHERE c.contype = 'f'
  AND conrelid::regclass::text = 'user_profiles';
